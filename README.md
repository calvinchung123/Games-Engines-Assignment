# Games-Engines-Assignment

## Summary
We are tasked to make a Unity application which uses procedural generation as its basis.
What I decided to make for my project is a Unity project which procedurally generates movement according to the 
music that you input to the program. There will be 3 main parts to this project: 
1. A centre which pulses to the bass
2. Rings orbitting the centre which pulse according to the lyrics
3. Flowers attached to the rings which change colour
## Background
I started off this project by looking at projects that were done by the 4th year students who just graduated. Alot of students 
From the previous year also did a similar project. This gave me inspiration for this project.

One project that i took a lot of inspiration from is a [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoO62u4m6JY&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5qaYwUOlJ63XI2OR9ty7Bs&index=5)
by Gary O'reilly. I particularily liked the sqhere design he opted for. What i wish to achieve is similar to his 
project but with added elements to it such as flowers attached to the rings and a core which moves to the music.

The next resource i looked at was a youtube guide on how to make a sound visualizer. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSgG_ziRKaQ&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5qaYwUOlJ63XI2OR9ty7Bs&index=14) was made by a recently graduated
TUDublin student Evgeny Timoshin. In his video he showed me a lot of cool visual effects which can be easily altered by changing one or many variables to alter the overall look and create a visually appealing
music visualizer

For this project i watched a few videos which discuss the topic of procedural generation. These videos gave me a better understanding on how procedural generation as a whole works and 
in what way can it be used for gaming/simulators/chat rooms etc. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU) i am going to mention is a more broad video which covers
all aspects of procedural generation. This video is on a talk about procedural generation. Kate Compton, the speaker disscuss's how procedural generation
works (Algorithms & AI) and factors when making a good procedural generator (Possiblity space & Expressive Range).

## Implementation
I am going to beak down the project into 4 sections:

- [ ] Creating the core of the sqhere 
- [ ] Creating rings which orbit the core
- [ ] creating flowers which attach to the rings
- [ ] Linking the music with the visuals

I am going to work on each section individually and combine all these elements together for a full visual effect. The list above will not be the order in which i create them at.


## Deliverables
- Unity Project
- Git Hub Repository
- A detailed description of what your assignment does and how it works
- Youtube video which shows the project functioning

## Final Readme

## Description of what I done

To start this assignment off I used the visualExample file that was given to me in the class. I used the AudioAnalyzer from this example for my audio analyzer. The next step in the creation of my audio visualizer was to create a pulsing core that responded to the audio. 
The steps taken to complete this were:
1. Creating cubes that reacted to audio
2. Attach the cubes onto a sphere
3. Make the cubes respond to different bandwidths
4. Make the cubes change color
5. Make the sphere rotate

The next step for the audio visualizer was to create the rings that orbit the core. I took inspiration from the Visualexample to create the rings. I created 4 rings and altered the angles of the rings so that it would form a sphere. I also made the rings rotate while the core rotates.
## What I am most proud of
I am most proud of the pulsating core in my project. This took a lot of time to get perfect but i am satisfied with the results. However I initially planned for it to only respond to the bass, this was changed. I made the core respond to 8 differend frequency bands instead. The one thing that i am dissapointed in is that i was not able to create the flowers that orbit the outside rings. I will however complete this in my own time so that this project will be finished to my liking.
## what resources were useful for me

The most useful resoure that i found online was a youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pmoP1ZOoNs&list=PL3POsQzaCw53p2tA6AWf7_AWgplskR0Vo) of a audio visualizer tutorial. This tutorial showed me the basics on how to create an audio visualizer.
