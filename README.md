# Games-Engines-Assignment

## Summary
We are tasked to make a Unity application which uses procedural generation as its basis.
What I decided to make for my project is a Unity project which procedurally generates movement according to the 
music that you input to the program. There will be 3 main parts to this project: 
1. A centre which pulses to the bass
2. Rings orbitting the centre which pulse according to the lyrics
3. Flowers attached to the rings which change colour
## Background
I started off this project by looking at projects that were done by the 4th year students who just graduated. Alot of students 
From the previous year also did a similar project. This gave me inspiration for this project.

One project that i took a lot of inspiration from is a [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoO62u4m6JY&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5qaYwUOlJ63XI2OR9ty7Bs&index=5)
by Gary O'reilly. I particularily liked the sqhere design he opted for. What i wish to achieve is similar to his 
project but with added elements to it such as flowers attached to the rings and a core which moves to the music.

The next resource i looked at was a youtube guide on how to make a sound visualizer. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSgG_ziRKaQ&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5qaYwUOlJ63XI2OR9ty7Bs&index=14) was made by a recently graduated
TUDublin student Evgeny Timoshin. In his video he showed me a lot of cool visual effects which can be easily altered by changing one or many variables to alter the overall look and create a visually appealing
music visualizer

For this project i watched a few videos which discuss the topic of procedural generation. These videos gave me a better understanding on how procedural generation as a whole works and 
in what way can it be used for gaming/simulators/chat rooms etc. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU) i am going to mention is a more broad video which covers
all aspects of procedural generation. This video is on a talk about procedural generation. Kate Compton, the speaker disscuss's how procedural generation
works (Algorithms & AI) and factors when making a good procedural generator (Possiblity space & Expressive Range).

## Implementation
I am going to beak down the project into 4 sections:

- [ ] Creating the core of the sqhere 
- [ ] Creating rings which orbit the core
- [ ] creating flowers which attach to the rings
- [ ] Linking the music with the visuals

I am going to work on each section individually and combine all these elements together for a full visual effect. The list above will not be the order in which i create them at.


## Deliverables
- Unity Project
- Git Hub Repository
- A detailed description of what your assignment does and how it works
- Youtube video which shows the project functioning
